## Motivation 
Coldfront is a simple web application focused on sharing public weather data and creating predictions. Coldfront has 2 primary functions: 
1. Display accurate weather datapoints in a free and open manner. 
2. Make NCAA Baseball (Razorbacks) rain delay predictions based aggregation on weather data.

## Constraints 
⚠️ Coldfront lacks an API that can programatically serve data regarding game dates and locations, and as such needs to be manually updated each season.
